## pyDrumBot

`pyDrumBot` is a drumming robot, producing random drum hits with the
chaotic glee of a mischievous and musically untrained seven year old child.

`pyDrumBot` is in pre-alpha stage. Planned features include:
- tempo control, from 60-240 bpm
- duration controls: set possible durations for random drum hits, from
  sixteenth notes to whole notes
- audio streams for two hands and a kick drum: simulate going gonzo on a
  typical rock-style drum kit, with two independent random-duration drum hit
  streams on a snare, toms, and cymbals, plus a third independent
  random-duration stream for the kick drum
- rest probability control: add randomness by setting the probability that a
  randomly-selected duration on any of the three audio streams generates a rest
  instead of a drum hit
